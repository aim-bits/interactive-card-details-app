## Overview
As a User types in his details it automatically displays simultaneously

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size


### Built with
- Tailwind CSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Process
I used React hook useState to enable the data typed to show simulateneously and I also used props in other to pass my data 
to different components

### What I learned

I became confident using Tailwind CSS, I learned how to logically use React Hook useState and know when to use a particular 
state management system, and most importantly know when to put a component into App.js and put another component into another component

### Continued development

- Mobile responsiveness
- Changing the UI after registeration for confirmation

### Useful resources

- [Kudvenkat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJPpae-WGM&t=166s) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
